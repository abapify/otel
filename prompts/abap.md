## General ABAP requirements

### Disclaimer

- in the beginning of every abap file please add disclaimer that the file is generated by AI and should not be modified manually

### Class/interface component name restriction

- please remember that any of interface/class component name (data, method, type, constant, event) should not be longer than 30 characters

### Naming conventions

- do not use any suffixes or prefixes in the type names unless it is required
- do not use any suffixes (like ty\_) or prefixes in the interface types

### ABAP types references

- please remember that in ABAP you can't reference a local type unless you declared it in the same file prior to the reference
- this means you need to apply the right order of types, not same as in source file

### Abapgit

- every generated .abap file should come with a separate abapgit descriptor file
- do not skip any single descriptor file. Since your output will be used in CI/CD - every file matters even if they are similar
- awlays generate package.devc.xml
